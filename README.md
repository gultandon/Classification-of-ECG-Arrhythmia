# Out-of-Hospital-Cardiac-Arrest-Detection-System
 Deep learning model that can detect irregular heartbeats.
 
 The ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset form Kaggle has been used. This dataset is composed of two collections of heartbeat signals derived from two famous datasets in heartbeat classification, the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset and The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. These signals are preprocessed and segmented, with each segment corresponding to a heartbeat.
 Here, Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU) has been applied for classifying the normal and abnormal beats in an ECG.
